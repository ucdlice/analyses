## use known mitochondrial clades to put our samples in perspective

##### Mitochondrial data from [Ashfaq et al., 2015](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep14188)

`ashfaq2015_cytb.fa` and  `ashfaq2015_coi.fa` have the genbank nucleotide sequences, 246 CYTB and 714 COI samples.

- Genbank FJ499475 is the minichromosome with CYTB
- Genbank FJ499477 is the minichromosome with COX1 (aka COI)
